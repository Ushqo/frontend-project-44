# Brain Games

### Description
The project is a small command-line application. 5 small games are implemented to entertain the user. This is:
* [Parity check](#parity-check) - prompts the user to guess whether the number is even or not.
* [Calculator](#calculator) - a random expression of two numbers is output to the terminal, and the user must guess the result of this expression.
* [Greatest common divisor](#greatest-common-divisor) - 2 random numbers are also output to the terminal, and the user needs to find the greatest common divisor for them.
* [Arithmetic progression](#arithmetic-progression) is a mini-game in which you need to guess the missing element in the arithmetic progression.
* [Is it a prime number?](#is-it-a-prime-number) - the user needs to find out and give an answer whether the number proposed by the program is prime.
